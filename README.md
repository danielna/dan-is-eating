=============

Mucking around with the flickr API.  Trying to visualize [this page](https://secure.flickr.com/photos/daniseating/).  Uses the jQuery library [isotope](https://github.com/desandro/isotope) for visualizing the photos in a pinterest-style layout.

Also using [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) and [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) for CSS.  Using [handlebars.js](http://handlebarsjs.com/) for javascript templating.
